abstract = {In an increasingly interconnected world, rising political polarization threatens social cohesion and democratic stability. Here, we demonstrate that the two trends might be fundamentally connected: Increasing social connectivity, often seen as a unifying force between people, can lead to polarization. Inspired by the physics of collective phenomena, we present a simple model that clarifies the underlying mechanisms. A polarization metric allows us to identify critical density thresholds at which social networks transition from diverse opinions to deeply divided societies. We show that empirically, polarization started to increase exactly with the advent of smartphones and social media. The results might help inspire strategies to mitigate the impact of polarization in digital and real-world communities. Over the past two decades, the number of close social connections increased substantially, at least by a factor of two. At the same time, societal opinions have become increasingly polarized in many Western countries. To explore whether these trends could be connected, we employ a simple computational model of society, where people—within their social networks—continuously compare and update their opinions. Here, we show that the model that is known to realistically capture both homophily and social balance exhibits a phase transition phenomenon where, above a critical social connectivity, an explosive transition toward strong polarization must occur. The model allows us to understand the empirical inflation of polarization during the last decades as a function of the observed increased values of social connectivity. In the presence of a small fraction of synchronized influencers, the transition becomes continuous; however, polarization then appears at lower connectivities. We discuss the implications of the presence of a phase transition in social polarization.}}
